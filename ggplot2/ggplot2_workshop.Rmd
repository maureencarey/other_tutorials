This tutorial is an introduction to make figures programmatically in R with ggplot2 and uses data from https://github.com/maureencarey/metabolomics

# Prep computational environment

```{r setup, include = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

path = "/Users/mac9jc/Documents/Documents - somH12CXJ8GJV40/work/projects/other_tutorials/ggplot2/"

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = path)

```

```{r, eval = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

path = "/path/to/data/"

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = path)

```

Load packages.

```{r,warning=TRUE, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse) #dplyr, tidyr
load("for_ggplot2_tutorial.RData")

```

Let's say you want to make a publication-quality figure like this:

```{r, include = F}

# merge metabolite abundance with group names
interesting_met_abund_w_grps = merge(t(rel_data), sample_info,
                                     by.x = "row.names", by.y = "samples") %>%
  column_to_rownames("Row.names") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(genetic_background,replicate,drug_treatment),
               names_to = "metabolite", values_to = "abundance")

# # compute limits
# ylim1 = interesting_met_abund_w_grps %>% 
#   group_by(metabolite, genetic_background, drug_treatment) %>%
#   summarise(boxplot= list(setNames(boxplot.stats(abundance)$stats,
#                                    c('lower_whisker','lower_hinge','median','upper_hinge','upper_whisker'))),
#             .groups = "keep") %>%
#   ungroup() %>% unnest_wider(boxplot)
# ylim1 = max(ylim1$upper_whisker) + 15
# limits = c(1, log10(ylim1))
# # plot
# p = ggplot(data = interesting_met_abund_w_grps, aes(x = metabolite, y = abundance, color = drug_treatment)) + # set variables
#   geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + # make it a boxplot, hide outliers
#   facet_wrap(~genetic_background) + # split
#   theme_minimal() +
#   theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
#         axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
#   ylim(c(0, max(ylim1$upper_whisker)+1)) +
#   coord_flip()
# p

pick_these = met_info[met_info$SUPER_PATHWAY == 'Carbohydrate' | met_info$SUPER_PATHWAY == 'Energy' | met_info$SUPER_PATHWAY == 'Cofactors and Vitamins',] %>% pull(COMP_ID)
p = ggplot(data = interesting_met_abund_w_grps %>% 
             filter(metabolite %in% pick_these), 
           aes(x = metabolite, y = abundance, color = drug_treatment)) + # set variables
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + # make it a boxplot, hide outliers
  facet_wrap(~genetic_background) + # split
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black","red")) +
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_log10() + ylab('abundance (log10), drug-treated in red') +
  coord_flip() +
  guides(color = F)
p

```

The biggest strength of making figures programmatically (as opposed to Excel or Prism, or other approaches that don't use code) is that your figures are 100% reproducible and customizable and all errors are traceable. Making figures in Excel or Prism may be easier to start, but there is no documentation (i.e. code) of what you did.

`ggplot2`, the package used here, is just one way to do it and my personal favorite. Strengths of `ggplot2` specifically are that its relatively easy to make publication quality figures and many application-focused packages provide even-easier-to-use wrappers for ggplot plotting (think: PCA from Tuesday's workshop with `phyloseq`). My favorite feature of `ggplot2` is how you can layer on new information or plotting approaches. For example, in the plot above, we first specified what data would be used and the x- and y-axes here:



```{r}

p = ggplot(data = interesting_met_abund_w_grps, aes(x = genetic_background, y = `52603`, color = drug_treatment))
p

```

Next, we told the program what type of plot to make (boxplot) so it plotted the data (specified in the first step) using this approach:

```{r}

p = p + geom_boxplot() 
p

```

Third, we layered on points:

```{r}

p = p + geom_point(size = 4) 
p

```

Fourth, we hide the legend:

```{r}

p = p + guides(color = F)
p

```

Fifth, we added statistics:

```{r}

p = p + stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons, size = 3, method = 't.test')
p

```

We could go even further, e.g. changing the color scheme, background, changing the axis labels, and adding a title:

```{r}

p = p + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("grey","blue","pink","green")) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("abundance") +
  ggtitle(paste(interesting_met, "abundance with t.test", sep = " "))
  
p

```

------

Next, let's look at all of the metabolites at once. For example, we'd expect to see a similar range of metabolite abundances in all sample groups. A histogram would be useful for this purpose.

```{r}

# remove Alignment ID column
met_abund_temp = met_abund
met_abund_temp$`Alignment ID` = NULL
# merge metabolite abundance with group names
met_abund_w_grps = rbind(grps,met_abund_temp)
# flip dataframe for easier plotting
df_to_plot = as.data.frame(t(met_abund_w_grps))
# add column headers for easier data access
colnames(df_to_plot)[1] = 'group'
# reorganize data
df_to_plot = tidyr::pivot_longer(df_to_plot, !group, names_to = "metabolite", values_to = "abundance")
# make sure the abundances are read as numbers not as text
df_to_plot$abundance = as.numeric(df_to_plot$abundance)

ggplot(data = df_to_plot, aes(x = abundance, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100) + scale_x_sqrt() +
  facet_wrap(~group) + guides(fill = F)

```

PS - Have questions about that 'pivot_longer' step? It's extremely useful but a little challenging to understand at first. Check this out:^[from https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2019/10/25/pivoting-tidily/]
